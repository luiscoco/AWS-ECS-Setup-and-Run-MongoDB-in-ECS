## Introduction of AWS ECS Elastic Container Service Instance

Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) is a fully managed container orchestration service that simplifies your deployment, management, and scaling of containerized applications. 

Simply describe your application and the resources required, and Amazon ECS will launch, monitor, and scale your application across flexible compute options with automatic integrations to other supporting AWS services that your application needs. 

Perform system operations such as creating custom scaling and capacity rules, and observe and query data from application logs and telemetry.

Amazon ECS is a fully managed container orchestration service that helps you to more efficiently deploy, manage, and scale containerized applications. 

It deeply integrates with the AWS environment to provide an easy-to-use solution for running container workloads in the cloud and on premises with advanced security features using Amazon ECS Anywhere.

**Benefits of AWS ECS Instance**

1. Modernize applications - Empower developers to build and deploy applications with enhanced security features in a fast, standardized, compliant, and cost-efficient manner with Amazon ECS.

2. Automatically scale web applications - Automatically scale and run web applications in multiple Availability Zones with the performance, scale, reliability, and availability of AWS.

3. Support batch processing - Plan, schedule, and run batch computing workloads across AWS services, including Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), AWS Fargate, and Amazon EC2 Spot Instances.

4. Train NLP and AI/ML models - Train natural language processing (NLP) and other artificial intelligence (AI) / machine learning (ML) models without managing the infrastructure by using Amazon ECS with AWS Fargate.

## NoSQL MongoDB

MongoDB is an open-source document database and leading NoSQL database. 

This video will give you complete understanding of running the MongoDB in docker container. 

Mongo Database is a physical container for collections. 

Each database gets its own set of files on the file system.

A single MongoDB server typically has multiple databases. 

Mongo DB Collection is a group of MongoDB documents. 

It is the equivalent of an RDBMS table. A collection exists within a single database. Collections do not enforce a schema. 

MongoDB Compass is a powerful GUI for querying, aggregating, and analyzing your MongoDB data in a visual environment. 

Compass is free to use and can be run on macOS, Windows, and Linux.
